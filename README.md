# Multi-stage Build Challenge

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use multi-stage building to optimize docker image file size.

For this was used a simple hello world written in golang and the final build is only 2MB

The image is available on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gscarv13/codeeducation)
